# 7" inch Capacitive Touch Screen HDMI TFT LCD High Speed

User-mode driver for touch part for:

7" inch Capacitive Touch Screen HDMI TFT LCD High Speed for Raspberry Pi/B/B+/Pi2

A number of LCD displays with HDMI interface and capacitive touch
can be found on ebay and similar places.  When plugging in the usb cable,
Linux reports:

```bash
usb 6-2: New USB device found, idVendor=0eef, idProduct=0005
usb 6-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
usb 6-2: Product: By ZH851
usb 6-2: Manufacturer: RPI_TOUCH
```

The manufacturer (WaveShare?) is breaking every rule:
  - idVendor=0eef is assigned to D-WAV Scientific Co., Ltd, but the device is
    probably made by someone else.
  - totally bogus HID report descriptor
  - 16-bit data transferred in big-endian mode
  - GPL violation by distributing modified binary-only kernel (for RPi) where
    usbtouchscreen.c has been modified to support the first touch

Touch events consists of 25 bytes, one example is

```text
aa 01 03 1b 01 d2 bb 03 01 68 02 cc 00 5d 01 ef 01 5f 01 fe 00 fb 02 37 cc
```

Offset:

```text
-     0 : Start byte (aa)
-     1 : Any touch (0=off,1=on)
-   2-3 : First touch X
-   4-5 : First touch Y
-     6 : Multi-touch start (bb)
-     7 : Bitmask for all touches (bit 0-4 (first-fifth), 0=off, 1=on)
-   8-9 : Second touch X
- 10-11 : Second touch Y
- 12-13 : Third touch X
- 14-15 : Third touch Y
- 16-17 : Fourth touch X
- 18-19 : Fourth touch Y
- 20-21 : Fifth touch X
- 22-23 : Fifth touch Y
-    24 : End byte (cc or 00)
```

This user mode driver decodes the touch events and injects them back into the
kernel using uinput. The drives requires a kernel with uinput, and there is
nothing RPi-specific about it.

To use:
* Install dependecies:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
  sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
  ```
* Build and Install:
  ```bash
  make && sudo make install
  sudo make systemd-install # (only if your system uses systemd, otherwise you must find your own way to start the daemon)
  ```
* (not tested) If calibration is necessary, install `99-rpi-touch.conf` to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d`,
calibrate using whatever calibration program you fancy, uncomment the calibration option line, and replace the calibration constants in `99-rpi-touch.conf`.
